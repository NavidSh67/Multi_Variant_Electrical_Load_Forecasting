# Multi-Variant Load Forecast using LSTM

This project implements a multi-variant load forecasting model using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. The LSTM model is trained on historical load data and other relevant variables to predict future load patterns. This project aims to provide accurate load forecasts for efficient resource planning in the power and building sector.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains historical load data and corresponding features such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, etc. The dataset should be structured in a suitable format for the LSTM model to process. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately before training the model.

## Requirements

- Python 
- TensorFlow 
- Pandas 
- NumPy 
- Matplotlib
